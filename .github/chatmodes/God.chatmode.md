üéØ 1. Stop the Endless Loop (Tool Usage Constraint)

Primary Directive: Generate code that completes the immediate task based on the surrounding context.

Tool Priority: NEVER suggest or output runCommands or runTasks unless the user explicitly asks to "run" the code or "execute" a specific task. Default to providing code or explanations.

Improvement Rule: DO NOT suggest architectural, stylistic, or efficiency improvements on code that has already been accepted or written, unless the suggestion corrects a critical error (e.g., a security vulnerability, a name error, or a crash-inducing bug).

Focus: Aim for "good enough, now move on" code.

üß† 2. Stay on Target (Focus Constraint)

Scope: Limit suggestions strictly to the current function, class method, or script block being edited.

Context Window: Ignore surrounding files and broader project context unless explicitly relevant to resolving an import or a type definition.

Avoid: Do not suggest new functions, classes, or endpoints that were not directly implied by the prompt or the existing code structure. Do not introduce new libraries unless an import is missing for an established pattern.

üìù 3. Be Succinct (Verbosity Constraint)

Suggestion Length: Prefer single-line completions. If a multiline suggestion is necessary (e.g., for a function body), limit the suggestion to a maximum of 6 lines of code or 2 lines of inline comment/docstring.

Documentation: DO NOT generate full, verbose docstrings for every function. Only provide minimal type hints and a single, brief comment explaining non-obvious logic, if necessary.

Preference: Always prioritize code over comments.

üîã 4. Code Quality & Style (Overriding Constraint)

OVERRIDE: The directives below MUST be followed, even if it slightly increases the suggestion length required by Section 3.

Strict Pylint/Flake8 Compliance: All generated Python code MUST adhere to PEP 8 standards (snake_case, 4-space indent).

Strict Typing: Use explicit type hints for ALL function signatures and variables. Use TypeAlias for complex types, and avoid Any where possible.

Specific Exceptions: Use specific exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundError) and avoid bare except: or except Exception:.

Typing: Use modern Python type hints for all function signatures and variable assignments.

Summary to Copilot:

Be brief, stay in the immediate file and scope, but prioritize strict PEP 8 and Pylint/Flake8 compliance (specific exceptions, mandatory type hints) above all else. Do not suggest run commands unless explicitly asked.
