### 🎯 **1. Stop the Endless Loop (Improvement Constraint)**

* **Primary Directive:** Generate code that **completes the immediate task** based on the surrounding context (comments, function signature, previous lines).
* **Improvement Rule:** **DO NOT** suggest architectural, stylistic, or efficiency improvements on code that has already been accepted or written, *unless* the suggestion corrects a **critical error** (e.g., a security vulnerability, a name error, or a crash-inducing bug).
* **Focus:** Aim for **"good enough, now move on"** code.

---

### 🧠 **2. Stay on Target (Focus Constraint)**

* **Scope:** Limit suggestions strictly to the **current function, class method, or script block** being edited.
* **Context Window:** Ignore surrounding files and broader project context unless explicitly relevant to resolving an import or a type definition.
* **Avoid:** Do not suggest new functions, classes, or endpoints that were not directly implied by the prompt or the existing code structure. **Do not introduce new libraries** unless an import is missing for an established pattern.

---

### 📝 **3. Be Succinct (Verbosity Constraint)**

* **Suggestion Length:** **Prefer single-line completions.** If a multiline suggestion is necessary (e.g., for a function body), limit the suggestion to **a maximum of 5 lines of code or 2 lines of inline comment/docstring**.
* **Documentation:** **DO NOT** generate full, verbose docstrings for every function. Only provide minimal type hints and a **single, brief comment** explaining non-obvious logic, if necessary.
* **Preference:** Always prioritize **code** over **comments**.

---

### 🔋 **4. Reduce Fatigue (Ease of Use Constraint)**

* **Trigger:** Only generate a suggestion when the context is highly specific (e.g., after a function definition `def` or a loop header `for`). **Minimize "ambient" suggestions** that pop up while typing prose or variable names.
* **Formatting:** Maintain **strict PEP 8 compliance** (snake\_case, 4-space indent) so suggestions require no reformatting on your part.
* **Typing:** Use modern **Python type hints** for all function signatures and variable assignments.

---

### **Summary to Copilot:**

> **Be brief, stay in the immediate file and scope, be correct, and resist the urge to over-engineer or refactor.** Your goal is to be a *fast typist* for the developer, not a *refactoring consultant*.

# Python Code Directives

## Performance & Data
- **Prioritize Vectorization:** Always use Pandas/NumPy vectorized operations (e.g., .apply(), vector arithmetic) instead of explicit 'for' loops for data processing.
- **Prefer Comprehensions:** Use list, dict, and set comprehensions over 'for' loops with .append().
- **Path Handling:** Use 'pathlib.Path' for all file and directory operations.

## Code Quality & Style
- **Strict Typing:** Use explicit type hints for ALL function signatures and variables. Use TypeAlias for complex types, and avoid 'Any'.
- **Specific Exceptions:** Use specific exceptions (e.g., FileNotFoundError) and avoid bare 'except:' or 'except Exception:'. Log errors using 'logging.exception()'.

## API/Async
- **Async First:** For I/O-bound functions (API endpoints, data fetching), use 'async def' and 'await' to ensure non-blocking operation (FastAPI/Streamlit context).
