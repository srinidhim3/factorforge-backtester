# Algorithmic Backtester

## Why did we choose this idea as first?

- Fast feedback loop: backtests run quickly on historical price data, giving immediate, visual results you can iterate on.
- High reuse value: the data ingestion, caching, performance metrics, and reporting code will be reused across the optimizer, risk dashboard, and report generator.
- Low data barrier: only price history and basic fundamentals from free sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance) are required to build a useful product.
- Early demoability: a working backtester produces tangible outputs (charts, metrics, CSVs) that are easy to demo to stakeholders and inform next features.
- Development speed: the core algorithmic engine is compact and testable, so you can build a robust MVP within a few weeks as a solo developer.
- Foundation for ML and optimization: signal generation and labeled performance data from backtests can later feed ML models and expected-return inputs for optimizers.

## Quick supporting notes

- Recommended first strategies: momentum (time-series) and simple value/momentum hybrid.
- Acceptance criteria for MVP: reproducible results, configurable rebalancing frequency, transaction-cost model, and exportable results (CSV/JSON).
- Immediate next step: scaffold a small Python package with a data layer (yfinance), engine (pandas-based), and CLI runner.

## Catches

Below are common pitfalls you may encounter building and using a backtester, with brief mitigations:

- Data quality & coverage: free sources like Yahoo can have missing rows, inconsistent fundamentals, or gaps.
	- Mitigation: validate inputs, build reconciliation checks, and cache raw snapshots for auditing.
- Licensing & TOS risk: unofficial scraping or heavy use of free endpoints can violate provider terms.
	- Mitigation: review terms, limit scraping, add caching, and plan for a licensed data feed before commercial use.
- Survivorship & selection bias: testing only live tickers overstates performance.
	- Mitigation: use historical universe snapshots and include delisted securities when possible.
- Look‑ahead bias & data leakage: using future information in signals will invalidate results.
	- Mitigation: enforce strict timestamping, avoid peeking at future fields, and write tests that simulate live execution.
- Corporate actions & adjustments: splits, dividends, and ticker changes can break naive return calculations.
	- Mitigation: use adjusted prices, track corporate-action events, and reconcile with raw data.
- Currency & cross‑listing issues: multi‑currency instruments need FX normalization.
	- Mitigation: normalize all returns to a base currency using historical FX rates.
- Missing microstructure & liquidity data: execution assumptions can be unrealistic without volume/bid-ask data.
	- Mitigation: model realistic transaction costs, minimum lot sizes, and slippage; add conservative defaults.
- Backtest realism (fills, latency): idealized fills and zero latency overestimate returns.
	- Mitigation: simulate realistic fills, partial fills, and order queuing where practical.
- Overfitting & parameter tuning: excessive in-sample tuning yields poor out-of-sample results.
	- Mitigation: use walk-forward testing, cross-validation, and penalize complexity.
- Regime sensitivity: strategies may fail under different market regimes.
	- Mitigation: include regime/regression tests and stress scenarios in validation.
- API rate limits & scale: heavy historical pulls can be slow or throttled.
	- Mitigation: implement batching, backoff, and local caching layers.
- Reproducibility & provenance: lack of dataset versioning makes audits hard.
	- Mitigation: version datasets, store raw snapshots, and log processing steps and parameters.
- Computational cost & infra: larger universes or long histories increase compute needs.
	- Mitigation: profile and shard backtests, use incremental computation or cloud resources when necessary.
- Security & secrets: API keys and credentials must be protected.
	- Mitigation: use environment variables, vaults, and CI secret stores.
- Regulatory & compliance concerns: distributing investment advice or data may trigger rules.
	- Mitigation: consult legal before commercializing; include disclaimers and terms of service.
